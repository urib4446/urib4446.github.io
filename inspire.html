        <h2>Why is Messi an inspiration for a lot of people</h2>
        <p> Someone that inspires me is the footballer named messi he is an inspiration because throught out his carrer he had a lot of obsticles he had to overcome, he had to leave his family and country when he was only 10 years old because of his perseverance to overcome his deficiency and build his soccer skills and his help towards children that are going through a similar, rough childhood, makes him a very importatn figure not only to me but to a lot of other people in my generation  </p>
        <p>Messi has is considered to be the best player in the history of football and this teaches us that everything is posible, during his childhood he was living in poverty now is the most payed athetle of the world and a person that has a lot of influence in the world .</p>
